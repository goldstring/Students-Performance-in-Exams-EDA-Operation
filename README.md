# 🎓 Student Exam Performance - Exploratory Data Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview

This project involves performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a dataset containing exam scores of students along with demographic and background information. The primary objective is to uncover insights about factors that may influence student performance in math, reading, and writing.

## 📝 Project Description

The dataset consists of 1,000 student records, including their scores in **math**, **reading**, and **writing**, as well as details like **gender**, **race/ethnicity**, **parental level of education**, **lunch type**, and whether the student completed a **test preparation course**.

By performing EDA, we aim to:
- Understand score distributions across subjects
- Compare performance across different demographic groups
- Identify patterns and correlations in student performance
- Evaluate the impact of test preparation on scores
- Visualize average performance and group-wise trends

The findings from this analysis can help educators and policymakers make data-driven decisions to improve educational outcomes.
